# 📋 STEP 3A: Import Repository on Vercel

## 🎯 What We're Doing
We're connecting Vercel to your GitHub repository so it can deploy your code.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions (On This Page)

### **Step 1: Install GitHub App (If You See This)**
- Look at the left column "Import Git Repository"
- If you see text: "Install the GitHub application..."
- Click the black button with GitHub logo that says **"Install"**
- This will open a new page
- Click **"Authorize"** or **"Install"** to allow Vercel to access your GitHub
- You'll be redirected back to this page

### **Step 2: Select Your GitHub Account**
- In the left column, you'll see a dropdown that says **"Select a Git Namespace"**
- Click on it
- You should see your GitHub username: `ap9629341-gif`
- Click on it to select

### **Step 3: Search for Your Repository**
- Below that, you'll see a search field that says **"Search..."**
- Click in that field
- Type: `rosepay-app`
- Your repository should appear in the list

### **Step 4: Select Your Repository**
- Click on **"rosepay-app"** (or `ap9629341-gif/rosepay-app`)
- It should be highlighted/selected

### **Step 5: Continue**
- After selecting, you should see a **"Continue"** or **"Import"** button
- Click it
- This will take you to the configuration page

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Can't see "rosepay-app" in search**
- Make sure you selected your GitHub account first
- Try typing the full name: `ap9629341-gif/rosepay-app`
- Refresh the page and try again

### **Problem: "Install GitHub application" button**
- Click it and authorize
- This is normal - Vercel needs permission to access your GitHub

### **Problem: No repositories showing**
- Make sure you're logged into the right GitHub account
- Check that your repository is public (or give Vercel access)
