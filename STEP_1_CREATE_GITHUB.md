# 📋 STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

## 🎯 What We're Doing
We're creating a place on GitHub to store your code online. Think of it like Google Drive, but for code!

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### **1. Open GitHub Website**
- Open your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
- Go to: **https://github.com**
- Wait for the page to load

### **2. Sign In (or Create Account)**
- If you already have a GitHub account:
  - Click **"Sign in"** (top right)
  - Enter your email and password
  - Click **"Sign in"**
  
- If you DON'T have an account:
  - Click **"Sign up"** (top right)
  - Enter your email
  - Create a password
  - Choose a username (like: `adarshpal` or `yourname`)
  - Click **"Create account"**
  - Verify your email if asked

### **3. Create New Repository**
Once you're logged in:
- Look at the top right corner
- You'll see a **"+"** button (plus sign)
- Click the **"+"** button
- A menu will appear
- Click **"New repository"**

### **4. Fill in Repository Details**
You'll see a form. Fill it like this:

- **Repository name**: Type `rosepay-app`
  - (Or any name you like - no spaces, use dashes if needed)
  
- **Description**: (Optional) Type: `My payment app`
  
- **Visibility**: 
  - Choose **"Public"** (so Vercel/Railway can access it)
  - OR **"Private"** (only you can see it - but you need to give access to Vercel/Railway)
  
- **IMPORTANT**: 
  - ❌ **DON'T** check "Add a README file"
  - ❌ **DON'T** check "Add .gitignore"
  - ❌ **DON'T** check "Choose a license"
  - Leave all checkboxes **UNCHECKED**

### **5. Create the Repository**
- Scroll down
- Click the green button: **"Create repository"**
- Wait a few seconds

### **6. Copy the Commands**
After creating, GitHub will show you a page with instructions.

**You'll see something like this:**
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rosepay-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**DON'T run these yet!** Just note that you see this page.
